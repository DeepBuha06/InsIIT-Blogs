## Running the project

By default, the project is hosted on Github pages [here](https://metis-iitgandhinagar.github.io/InsIIT-Blogs/). There are few dummy blogs present here. You cannot create any blogs or create your account here, which is by design. 
If you want to write to the database/create account: 
1. Create a firebase project ([how](https://medium.com/@androidcrypto/setup-of-a-firebase-project-tutorial-step-by-step-a91f0718e7b7)).
2. Fork and clone this repository.
3. From firebase console on, create a web app for your project, copy the firebaseConfig you will get while doing that.
4. Replace the firebaseConfig from js/firebaseConfig.js.
5. Enable Google Sign In from firebase console.
6. Enable Firestore from the firebase console.

## Contributing to the project

We recommend that you start working on features from the Issues tab of the repository. You are free to work on your own features, but make sure that you first create an Issue, and get a confirmation from the maintainers if the feature is necessary.
To start contributing, first fork this repository, then clone it to your computer. Make your changes. Create a pull request.

Please follow the following practices for better collaboration:
1. Write code that is readable and as much as possible, follows the coding style already present in the project.
2. Solve only 1 problem per pull request. Create a separate pull request for every feature/bug solved.
3. Describe what you did clearly in the pull request.
